## Usage
This process will become simpler as the plugins become more developed.

1. Install the plugin on a Nukkit server
2. Run the server, stop it, and edit the config (making sure to change the `key` value unless you're just testing)
3. Launch Blockbench, drag and drop the `benchkit.js` file into the page (it will import the plugin)
4. Click the `Benchkit` menu at the top of the screen and select `Connect to Minecraft Server` and enter the details (keybind coming soon) 
5. Once connected, go about editng your skin and then click `Apply Skin on Server` in the `Benchkit` menu (next time you want to apply the skin to the same player just hit `CTRL+SHIFT+L`)
6. Done! Your skin will change in game instantly
